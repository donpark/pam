## NOTE by @donpark

Noticed only just now that connection to original project is not there,
perhaps because it has been removed for reasons unknown to me.
At least the original LICENSE is there.

This note is to make it clear that most of the code is by @zacheryph and
I only fixed some build errors to get it working.

# pam

PAM interaction for Go.  Currently consists of functionality to implement your own module
for PAM to load/communicate with for each service.

## Install

> `go get github.com/donpark/pam`

## Usage

Declare PAM request handling methods like this:

```go

  import "github.com/donpark/pam"
  
  type mypam struct {
    // your pam vars
  }

  func (mp *mypam) Authenticate(hdl pam.Handle, args pam.Args) pam.Value {
    fmt.Println("Authenticate:", args)
    return pam.Success
  }

  func (mp *mypam) SetCredential(hdl pam.Handle, args pam.Args) pam.Value {
    fmt.Println("SetCredential:", args)
    return pam.Success
  }

  var mp mypam

  func init() {
    pam.RegisterAuthHandler(&mp)
  }

  func main() {
    // needed in c-shared buildmode
  }
```

Build custom PAM shared library

    go build -buildmode=c-shared -o /lib64/security/pam_mypam.so main.go

For 32-bit env, `/lib/security` directory should be used.

## Credits

I looked off of [golang-pam-auth](https://github.com/AmandaCameron/golang-pam-auth) a bit for
initial coding of pam method translations.  Thanks has to go out to Amanda for her work here.
The conversation code is mostly pulled directly from hers.
